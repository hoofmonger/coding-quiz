# coding-quiz
# this is a mathmatics quiz with three questions
# each question must be input into the text box as a number, spelling out the word will not work
# I originally tried to make this work with a multiple choice format, first with buttons, then with check boxes.
# after both proved over my head, I shifted to what I do know, which is matching inputs to each other.
# so I switched processes and ended up here.
# HTML and CSS were both used to build the body of the page, with Javascript as the brain.
# I ran into some trouble with the Javascript, as it pertained to shifting the view of the page, and saving variables in the local storage
# anyway, enjoy this refresher on ninth grade math
